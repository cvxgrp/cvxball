"""
Approximation of π using convex optimization.

This script demonstrates how to approximate the value of π using a convex optimization approach.
It formulates a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem to find a polynomial that
under-approximates the quarter-circle, then computes the integral of this polynomial
from 0 to 1 and multiplies by 4 to get an approximation of π.

The approach uses a polynomial of the form p(x) = a + bx^2 + cx^4 and constrains it to
stay below the quarter-circle curve sqrt(1-x^2) for x in [0,1]. By maximizing the
integral of this polynomial and multiplying by 4, we get a lower bound approximation of π.

This is an example of how convex optimization can be used for numerical approximation
of mathematical constants.
